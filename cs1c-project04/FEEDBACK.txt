FEEDBACK:

Nice clean implementation of your Queue class, especially en/dequeue() methods.


Good clean implementation of the QueueIterator class.


Very good testing of your implementation.


Very use of exception handling when dequeuing from an empty Queue.
   Remember to add the exception to the method signature.

-Bita.
