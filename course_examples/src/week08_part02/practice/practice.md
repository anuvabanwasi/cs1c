Learning Objectives
-------------------
- Binary Heap


Problem 1
---------

**Show the result of inserting the elements into a min binary heap.**

```java
10, 12, 1, 14, 6, 5, 8, 15, 3, 9, 7, 4, 11, 13 and 2
```

Note: Assume we are inserting the elements one at a time into an *empty* **min** binary heap.

Make sure to show each iteration of the tree as you insert an element.
