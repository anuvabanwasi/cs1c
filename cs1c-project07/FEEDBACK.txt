FEEDBACK:

Very good testing of the FIND_SONG_BY_ID and the FIND_SONG_BY_GENRE selection.


Good overloading of hashCode() and compareTo() methods in wrapper 
   classes SongsCompInt and SongsInGenre.
   
   
Extra Credit Opportunity:
+2.0 Excellent analysis of search times of hash table vs array of song objects via 
     graphical representation!

+2.0 Excellent graphical representation and description of findings!

-Bita.
